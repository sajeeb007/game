# Dice Game
This is a Dice game that I created in process of learning Javascript. It uses DOM and random number generator to generate random dice and then
declares a winner that helps disputing stuffs between two people.

Note that the game is not an original idea. The instructor showed me a demo and I build it up just like that to test out my skil.
